# Regular Expressions in Python
## What is a Regular Expression?
- A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, mainly used for string searching and manipulation.
## Importing the re Module
````
import re
````
## Basic Functions in re
- `re.search()`: Searches a string for a match and returns a match object.
````
import re
text = "My number is 07239112534"
match = re.search(r'\d+', text)
if match:
    print(match.group())  # 07239112534
````
- `re.findall()`: Returns a list of all matches.
````
text = "My numbers are 07239112534 and 070031356352"
numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', text)
print(numbers)  # ['07239112534', '070031356352']
````
- `re.match()`: Checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.
