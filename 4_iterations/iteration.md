# Iteration in Python

## Types of Loops
- `while` loop
- `for` loop

## Useful Keywords
- `break`: Used to get out of an infinite loop
- `continue`: Can be used to skip to the next iteration without finishing the body of the loop of the current iteraration.
- `pass`:  Used as a placeholder. It does nothing literally, but it prevents errors when Python expects a block of code.

## Examples
- Looping through a list
- Counting with a `while` loop
