# Functions in Python

## What is a Function?
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

## Why Use Functions?
- Avoid repetition
- Improve code organization
- Make code easier to test and maintain

## Build in Functions
- Python provides a number of important built-in functions that we can use without
 needing to provide the function definition. Examples of these functions are; max(),min(),float(),len()
str(),etc.

## Adding New Function Syntax
- def function_name(parameters):
    - code block
    - return result
  
## Void Functions
- They perform action but return no value.

## Fruitful Functions
- These functions yield results such as the math function. 
- They should be assigned to a variable unlike the void functions
